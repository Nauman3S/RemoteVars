1)DEBUG FIXED, chnage DEVMODE to 0 in IoTLibrary.h and it will not print everything
2)Now the data json is sent to CommunicationHandler and the CommunicationHandler automatically extract mqtt topic and 
mqtt data from the incommingJSON and send it to publish fucntion
3)Value field is handled properley I have put it in the last but it will not make any difference

Almost done. The biggest issue is that everything prints all the time. 
Even if the value doesn't change. The is what ON_CHANGE means.

And I have strange output:

{DataType:i,Value:199,DataTopic:Topic1,ID:1,Permission:2,Event:3,Method:1}
{DataType:d,Value:69.53,DataTopic:Topic2,ID:3,Permission:2,Event:3,Method:1}
3,Method:1}




Also, setting DEBUG to 0 causes nothing to print. I can fix it.


And how is MQTT supposed to work when the Topic is in the message?
 That should be passed to the communication handler. 
 The communication class should deal with that kind of meta data. I know how to fix it.

Also, the Value: field should be last incase it contains any of your keywords.

Also, how is remote_potentiometer being called in your example? I see nowhere that any serial data is read.

String CommunicationHandler::readJSONString(){
//printf("COMMHANDLE AS A READER");
char startW='{';
char endW='}';
String incommingJSON="";
//read from serial, wifi, rf etc from '{' to '}' and store it in the variable above
return incommingJSON;
}

I don't know what code you are running.

A small note, data structures like strings should be sent as base64.  
Unless you plan on escaping special characters like "}" or just not allowing it.  I can fix that also.
